# Model to predict the demand for shared bikes

In this notebook, we'll build a regression model to predict the `demand` of shared bikes using appropriate predictor variables.

#### Problem Statement:

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Essentially, the company wants â€”
